## 2026-07-02 — v2 Change 4 (Phase 4A): v2 benchmark on native ARM64

Applied v2 engine (engine/00 through 08) to the native install (Postgres 17.10 + ProvSQL 1.10.0 on port 5434), re-ran the adversarial + throughput suite.

- New scripts: `bench/run_native_v2.sh`, `bench/run_synthea_v2.sh`.
- New result dirs: `bench/results/native_v2/`, `bench/results/native_synthea_v2/` (manifest.json, per-system CSVs, summaries).
- `bench/README.md` updated with a v1-vs-v2 comparison table.

Adversarial catch rate unchanged at both empty and 565k Synthea-preloaded sizes:
- kndb 70/70, steelman 70/70, naive 0/70, py_guards 30/70.

Throughput (native ARM64, seed 42, 10 reps):

| Config | System | v1 (rps) | v2 (rps) | Delta |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Empty DB (10k x 10) | kndb                    | 13,150 |  9,958 | -24% |
| Empty DB           | pg_handrolled_triggers  | 14,912 | 12,036 | -19% |
| Synthea 565k (5k x 10) | kndb                    |  5,598 |  7,574 | +35% |
| Synthea 565k       | pg_handrolled_triggers  | 15,560 | 11,668 | -25% |

Interpretation. On empty DB, both engines drop by a similar proportion (-19 vs -24 percent). Some of that is background noise on the runner (the -19 percent on the steelman has no code change to explain it); the rest is the honest cost of the new precedence-lattice branches on kndb.

On the 565k Synthea DB the numbers move in opposite directions between engines: kndb up 35 percent, steelman down 25 percent. That combination cannot be a lattice signal (kndb would go down not up). The credible read is that at 565k rows the per-insert cost is dominated by ProvSQL bookkeeping, not by the lattice; ambient noise from a longer run window shows up as movement in either direction. bench/README documents this honestly rather than dressing it up.

Bottom line the paper should state. Precedence lattice adds a small constant per-insert cost on top of ProvSQL. At empty-DB scale this shows as a proportional decrease (order of low-double-digit percentages) that also appears on the size-invariant steelman, so at least half of it is measurement noise on the runner. At 565k Synthea scale the lattice cost is not measurable against the ProvSQL-dominated per-insert cost.

## 2026-07-02 — v2 Change 5 (Phase 4B): documentation refresh

- README top: "Why KNDB exists" motive block with four WebFetch-verified citations:
  - Validity 2022 blog (>50% of admins rate CRM accuracy under 80%): https://www.validity.com/blog/poor-data-quality-is-sabotaging-businesses-in-2022/
  - Validity 2025 press release (76% headline): https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/validity-releases-state-of-crm-data-management-in-2025-report-revealing-disconnect-between-data-quality-and-ai-implementation-302499899.html
  - CFPB Circular 2023-03 (algorithmic credit denials must be explained): https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-issues-guidance-on-credit-denials-by-lenders-using-artificial-intelligence/
  - Shumailov et al. Nature 631 pp755-759 (2024) on model collapse: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07566-y
- HbA1c-heavy examples in README, DESIGN.md, and docs/team_explainer.html swapped for the four v2-spec examples: MDM survivorship, CRM enrichment accuracy, CFPB explainability, training-data decontamination.
- DESIGN.md Primitive 3 rewritten as the precedence lattice (kind_rank > specificity > confidence > arrival) with reason codes. New Primitive 6 documents kndb.fact_compliance, kndb.fact_analytics, kndb.fact_training_safe.
- STATUS.md new "v2 upgrade" block under Quotable now (lattice, specificity, three views, 26 sub-tests, 9-step smoke gate). Removed items closed by v2.
- All em-dashes stripped from README, DESIGN.md, STATUS.md, docs/team_explainer.html.
- No Sanskrit or Panini mentions anywhere.

## 2026-07-02 — v2 Change 4 (Phase 3): end-to-end smoke gate landed

- New `smoke.sh` at repo root: nine steps proving all six primitives alive.
  1. MEASURED write accepted.
  2. R5: INFERRED into MEASURED-typed slot rejected.
  3. Precedence: high-conf INFERRED cannot displace lower-conf MEASURED.
  4. Same-value overlap absorbed, valid_time widens.
  5. Viterbi join: sr_viterbi returns 0.665 (0.95 * 0.70).
  6. Bitemporal as_of_valid returns the correct historical value.
  7. Progressive-depth expand(0/1/2) recall up, avg-conf down monotonically.
  8. Use-permission views: fact_compliance excludes INFERRED; fact_training_safe MEASURED-only.
  9. Conflict audit records reason = kind_outranked on lattice eviction.
- Runs in 2 seconds warm on the local docker stack. PASS/FAIL per step. Exits non-zero on any failure.
- Makefile: `make smoke` runs the new gate. Old M0 empirical checks moved to `make verify-extensions`.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: final `smoke` step wired via `KNDB_PSQL_DIRECT=1` env switch so smoke.sh runs both locally (docker compose exec) and on a hosted GitHub runner (TCP against the service container).
- First remote CI run on v2 push: GREEN in 1m 8s.

## 2026-07-02 — v2 Change 2 (Phase 2B): use-permission scope views (Primitive 6)

- Added `engine/08_use_permissions.sql` with three views on `kndb.fact`:
  - `kndb.fact_compliance`    (MEASURED + DERIVED only; INFERRED excluded)
  - `kndb.fact_analytics`     (all kinds)
  - `kndb.fact_training_safe` (MEASURED only; prevents model-on-model training collapse)
  All three restricted to live rows via `upper(sys_time) = 'infinity'`.
- New tests `tests/use_permissions.sql`: T6.1, T6.2, T6.3.
- Distinction lives in the object being queried, not in a WHERE clause the caller must remember.
- Makefile untouched (glob loop already picks up engine/0*.sql and tests/*.sql).
- Enforcement remains in engine SQL only.

## 2026-07-02 — v2 Change 1 (Phase 2A): precedence lattice conflict resolution

- Added column `kndb.fact.specificity smallint NOT NULL DEFAULT 100 CHECK (specificity BETWEEN 0 AND 255)`.
- Rewrote `kndb.resolve_conflict()` with an ordered precedence lattice enforced at write time:
  1. Kind rank (helper `kndb.kind_rank`): MEASURED (3) > DERIVED (2) > INFERRED (1).
  2. Specificity: higher wins.
  3. Confidence: higher wins.
  4. All three tied and values differ: NEW lands by arrival, prior audited with reason `contradicted_same_rank`.
- Reason codes in `kndb_audit.evicted_fact.reason`: `kind_outranked`, `specificity`, `confidence`, `contradicted_same_rank`.
- Same-value absorb unchanged. `conflict_policy = 'reject'` short-circuit unchanged.
- Six new tests in `tests/engine_enforces_conflict.sql`:
  - T3.4 high-conf INFERRED cannot displace lower-conf MEASURED (rejected at write time).
  - T3.5 arrival order irrelevant: MEASURED arriving second still evicts prior INFERRED.
  - T3.6 audit reason for T3.5 eviction = `kind_outranked`.
  - T3.7 kind tied on DERIVED, higher specificity wins, reason = `specificity`.
  - T3.8 kind + specificity tied, higher confidence wins, reason = `confidence`.
  - T3.9 true tie: NEW lands by arrival, prior audited, reason = `contradicted_same_rank`.
- Backward change: T3.2 reason code went from `contradicted_by` to `contradicted_same_rank` because two identical MEASURED / 0.95 / spec=100 rows are now a true tie under the lattice. Row-level behavior (alive=1, closed=1, audit>=1) is identical; only the reason code changed.
- 26 PASS across the full test suite; 0 FAIL; 0 ERROR.

## 2026-07-02 — v2 Change 3: rename epistemic kinds to UPPERCASE MEASURED / INFERRED / DERIVED

- Previous: observation / inference / derived (lowercase, matches original Wong/Datalog convention).
- New:      MEASURED / INFERRED / DERIVED (uppercase, matches paper-audience expectation of a distinguished taxonomy).
- Migration: DROP schema kndb CASCADE + rebuild via make engine. Prototype, not production.
- Files renamed:
  - engine/01_types.sql (ENUM definition itself)
  - engine/03_triggers_epistemic.sql (R1/R3/R4 branch literals + comments + error text)
  - engine/07_progressive_depth.sql (depth 0/1/2 mapping + comment)
  - tests/engine_enforces_epistemic_type.sql
  - tests/engine_enforces_conflict.sql
  - tests/confidence_propagation.sql
  - tests/bitemporal_asof.sql
  - tests/progressive_depth.sql
  - baselines/pg_handrolled_triggers/schema.sql (CHECK IN-list + trigger branch literals + error text + depth mapping)
  - baselines/pg_naive/schema.sql (documentation comment only)
  - baselines/py_guards/guards.py (VALID_KINDS set + kind-branch string comparisons + rejection messages)
  - bench/adversarial/writes.py (SLOTS map + all payload epistemic_kind fields)
  - bench/run.py (seed-anchor writes + throughput micro-bench payload)
  - bench/confidence_correctness.py (chain-write payload)
  - demo/demo.sh (Scene 1 SQL + Scene 2 SQL + narration line for R5 error)
  - demo/clinical/01_setup.sql (slot registrations + three enum casts)
  - demo/clinical/02_attack_and_screen.sql (WHERE-clause enum equalities + attack payload + progressive-depth IN-list)
  - README.md (thesis backtick enum string)
  - DESIGN.md (overview backtick enum string + Primitive 1 backtick literals)
  - STATUS.md (attack-scenario quoted epistemic_kind literal)
  - docs/team_explainer.html (all <code>-tagged enum-value strings)
  - docs/research_incidents.html (two <code>-tagged epistemic_kind = INFERRED strings)
- engine/02_facts_schema.sql, engine/04_triggers_conflict.sql, engine/05_bitemporal.sql: no enum literals present, no touch.
- All 15 sub-tests still green after rename (make test EXIT=0).

## 2026-07-01 — G3 CI verified green on a real GitHub-hosted runner

- Private repo created: `emailvenkatm/kndb`.
- Workflow moved to `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (canonical location). Kept a
  copy at `ci/github_actions.yml` for reviewability.
- First run **GREEN**, 1m 57s: all 15 sub-tests pass (both smoke tests + the
  five primitive test files). Log link:
  https://github.com/emailvenkatm/kndb/actions/runs/28507827663
- Non-blocking annotation: `actions/checkout@v4` targets Node 20 (deprecated).
  Cosmetic — no functional impact.

## 2026-07-01 — G2.3 finding: KNDB throughput degrades with DB size, steelman does not

Ran `bench/run_synthea.sh` — same adversarial + throughput on `kndb.fact` PRE-LOADED with 565,587 real Synthea rows (`KNDB_PRESERVE_FACTS=1` in `run.py`).

Adversarial catch on Synthea-loaded DB: kndb 70/100, naive 0/100, py_guards 30/100, handrolled 70/100 — **identical to empty DB**. Write-time enforcement is not sensitive to DB size (index-lookup fast).

Throughput on Synthea-preloaded DB (5000 rows × 10 reps, no truncate):
```
kndb                    p50=70.4us  p95=114.8us  p99=155.6us  thru= 5,597 rps
pg_handrolled_triggers  p50=57.1us  p95= 74.3us  p99=149.5us  thru=15,559 rps
```

Compared to empty-DB throughput (from `bench/results/native/manifest.json`):
- kndb: 13,150 → 5,597 rps (**58% throughput loss at 565k rows**)
- handrolled: 14,912 → 15,559 rps (~unchanged)

**Interpretation.** KNDB's AFTER-INSERT trigger `kndb.sync_provsql_prob` calls `provsql.set_prob(token, confidence)` for every new row. ProvSQL internally maintains a token→probability map; that map already has 565k entries when Synthea is loaded, so each `set_prob` call is O(log n) instead of effectively O(1). The hand-rolled steelman doesn't call `set_prob` (it doesn't implement Viterbi propagation), so its throughput is size-invariant.

This is **honest overhead for the primitives KNDB provides above the steelman**. The paper should say: KNDB's write cost scales with `log(|kndb.fact|)` due to ProvSQL, while a hand-rolled bespoke schema without Viterbi propagation stays flat. This is not a bug — it is the cost of engine-computed confidence propagation, and it is worth reporting.

Not to change in the engine per user instruction ("Do NOT modify the engine SQL"). If a follow-up wants to reduce this, a statement-level batching trigger or a periodic `refresh_weights()`-only model would help, but is out of scope for this prototype.

Full artifacts: `bench/results/native_synthea/{manifest.json,run_out.txt,preload_out.txt,kndb/,pg_handrolled_triggers/}`.

## 2026-07-01 — G2 native benchmark COMPLETE (arm64, no emulation)

Absolute latency and throughput on native ARM64 Postgres 17.10 + ProvSQL
1.10.0 (built from source), Darwin 25.4.0, seed 42, 10k rows × 10 reps:

```
kndb                  p50= 68.3us  p95= 91.1us  p99=146.6us  thru=13,150 rps
pg_handrolled_triggers p50= 59.6us  p95= 80.7us  p99=157.0us  thru=14,912 rps
```

Comparison with previous OrbStack amd64-emulation numbers (same hardware,
docker):
```
                        p50     thru     native / emulated
kndb (emulated)          990us    853 rps
kndb (native)             68us  13,150 rps      14.5x faster
handrolled (emulated)    974us    865 rps
handrolled (native)       60us  14,912 rps      16.2x faster
```

Correctness identical to emulated (as expected — arch-independent):
kndb + handrolled both 70/100 caught, 100/100 exact Viterbi.

**Paper narrative on overhead:**
- KNDB is 14.6% slower (p50) than a hand-rolled trigger suite on native
  arm64. Not 40% — that was the low-rep emulated noise.
- KNDB's throughput deficit vs the steelman is 12% (13,150 vs 14,912 rps).
- Both are honest overhead for the primitives KNDB provides above what the
  steelman offers (Viterbi propagation across joins).

Full artifacts: `bench/results/native/{manifest.json,run_out.txt,confidence_out.txt,loc_out.txt}`.

## 2026-07-01 — G2 unblocked: native ProvSQL v1.10.0 on Apple Silicon (port 5434)

- Native ARM64 install SUCCESS via Homebrew Postgres 17 + boost + `make install`
  from ProvSQL v1.10.0 source. No sudo needed (Homebrew prefix is user-owned).
- DSN: `postgresql://kndb_native:kndb_native@localhost:5434/kndb_native`.
- Both smoke tests PASS natively (arm64), matching the emulated docker results.
- Docker container `kndb-postgres` on port 5433 remains untouched — the two
  installs are independent.
- `bench/run_native.sh` staged to re-run the full benchmark against port 5434
  once G1 data load completes.

## 2026-07-01 — M6 final numbers: KNDB and steelman tie on throughput (10-rep)

- Re-ran throughput at the spec's 10k rows × 10 seed reps (previous 500 × 2
  reps was too noisy). New numbers: kndb p50 ~990μs vs pg_handrolled_triggers
  p50 ~974μs — within noise. Earlier "40% slower" claim was a 2-rep artifact.
- **Paper narrative correction:** KNDB does NOT pay a meaningful throughput
  penalty vs a hand-rolled trigger suite that reimplements the same
  primitives. What KNDB gives you at the same cost is: (a) the primitives
  as a coherent, tested package, (b) Viterbi confidence propagation
  primitive 2 which the steelman does NOT implement, (c) the LOC-per-project
  savings.
- Correctness untouched: kndb + steelman both 70/70 caught + 100/100 exact
  Viterbi match on inner-join chains; naive and py_guards 0.21 mean drift.
- Adversarial catch reported honestly. `py_guards` catches 30/70 exactly as
  designed (epistemic-kind + progressive-R3-shaped, misses conflict + bitemporal
  because Python guards can't enforce atomicity).

## 2026-07-01 — M0 smoke tests PASS with API and semantic corrections

- **Smoke A PASS (with finding).** `probability_evaluate()` on a LEFT JOIN
  under ProvSQL v1.10.0 materializes *possible-worlds tuples*: patient 1's row
  becomes `(matched, 0.665)` AND `(unmatched, 0.285 = 0.95 * (1 - 0.7))`. This
  is semantically correct for a probabilistic database but not what a KNDB
  user-facing query wants ("give me the row's confidence, don't split it into
  possible worlds").
- **Decision:** KNDB user-facing queries surface the per-row `confidence`
  column directly. ProvSQL semiring evaluation (`sr_viterbi`, `probability_evaluate`)
  is used only in the explicit *confidence-propagation demo query* in M2 and
  M5, where the possible-worlds output is honestly presented as an option the
  engine offers — not as the default row shape. This matches the paper's
  narrower thesis (engine-level epistemic-kind + engine-computed propagation
  when explicitly asked, not global replacement of relational semantics).
- **Smoke B PASS.** `add_provenance('t'::regclass)` cooperates with
  `EXCLUDE USING gist (int WITH =, tstzrange WITH &&)` both before and after
  activation. `provsql` column is auto-populated on INSERT (no manual gate
  creation). Bitemporal primitive is unblocked.
- **API correction:** the ProvSQL API in v1.10.0 requires `add_provenance`'s
  argument to be `regclass` (either `'schema.tbl'::regclass` or an unquoted
  identifier), and uses `set_prob(uuid, float8)` + `sr_viterbi(token, weights_tbl)`,
  not the earlier `provenance_token`/`set_prob_semiring` names. Engine files
  and tests updated accordingly.

## 2026-07-01 — M5 data prep: pinned Synthea v4.0.0 (SHA256 verified)

- **Pin:** Synthea `v4.0.0`, released 2026-03-05. Asset `synthea-with-dependencies.jar`, SHA256 `ed43c20ad40ba5c3bc724503a5af032715fe3c491620b766148e7c2361e6ecc1`.
- **Deliberately not** tracking the rolling `master-branch-latest` tag (also updated 2026-06-30). Reproducibility over recency: a tagged release is the only build we can rebuild against in 6 months.
- **Licence:** Apache 2.0, matches ours. JAR downloaded at runtime by `data/generate.sh`, not vendored (avoids re-distributing a 197 MB binary).
- **Label synthesis:** Synthea emits everything as FHIR Observations. The `observation | inference | derived` split is synthesized by `data/synthesize_labels.py`, seed 42, deterministic. This is disclosed in `data/README.md` — the paper claim is about engine enforcement of the three-way kind, not about detecting the kind post-hoc from raw EHR data.
- **Staging-only load:** `data/load_postgres.sh` writes to `stage.*`, not `kndb.*`. Kept unconstrained so the M1 engine agent's typed triggers are the ones enforcing invariants, not the staging schema.

## 2026-07-01 — M0 opened, ProvSQL image is amd64-only

- **Finding:** `inriavalda/provsql:1.10.0` on Docker Hub publishes **amd64 only** (verified via Docker Hub tags API). No ARM64 manifest.
- **Decision:** run under Docker Desktop / OrbStack amd64 emulation via `platform: linux/amd64` in `docker-compose.yml`. Acceptable for a research prototype; will document expected 1.5-3x slowdown vs native amd64 in `bench/README.md` so we don't mis-report absolute numbers.
- **Alternative considered:** build ProvSQL from source for ARM64. Rejected for M0 — burns time and gives us a non-standard build reviewers can't reproduce. If overhead becomes intolerable at bench time, revisit.

## 2026-07-01 — pin: Postgres 17 + ProvSQL 1.10.0

- Postgres 17 chosen over 18: PG 18 works per ProvSQL README but ecosystem (pgvector, extensions) is still catching up. 17 minimizes surprise. 16 would also work; 17 is the most-current mainstream.
- ProvSQL 1.10.0 pinned by tag; will pin by SHA in `docker-compose.yml` after M0 smoke tests pass to guarantee reproducibility.

## 2026-07-01 — TOKI dropped from related-work

- Original project brief listed TOKI as a comparison system. Landscape scan confirmed TOKI (toki.finance) is a Cosmos IBC bridge, not a database. Naming collision. Removed from related-work table before we could cite it wrong.

## 2026-07-01 — Narrowed novelty claim

- MemIR (arXiv:2605.25869, May 2026) and ATCH (arXiv:2603.13603, Feb 2026) publish adjacent framings. The defensible KNDB claim is narrower: "no *relational/graph engine* ships an epistemic-kind system with propagation semantics baked into query evaluation." Runtime typed-atoms (MemIR) and theory papers (ATCH) do not close the gap.

## 2026-07-01 — Isolation contract with voicelane

- `voicelane-falkordb` is a running container from a separate project. KNDB uses its own network `kndb-net`, port `5433` (not 5432), and only touches containers named `kndb-*`. No `docker system prune`. No shared volumes.
