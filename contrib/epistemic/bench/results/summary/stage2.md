# Stage 2 — correctness axis + four baselines

F10 report on the YCSB microbench.

Test cluster: PG 18.4 at /tmp/kndb_pg18_test:55480,
`shared_preload_libraries='epistemic'`, defaults otherwise.
Hardware: Apple M5 Pro, 18 cores, 48 GB RAM, macOS 26.4.1, unix
socket (no TCP).
Driver: `bench/driver/correctness.py` (Python 3, psycopg3).
Cells: 78 correctness cells + disable-and-test transcripts + reduced
control cells. Measurement window 20 s per cell, warm-up 3 s, one run
per cell (Stage 1's 30 s × 3 runs would have blown the wall-clock
budget; Stage 2 traded run-count for grid width).

## What Stage 2 adds

Stage 1 measured throughput, abort rate, and latency for three
targets (KNDB epistemic AM, pg_heap, pg_trigger). Stage 2 adds:

1. **Four more baselines**: `pg_lww`, `pg_llm`, `pg_conf`, `pg_mv`.
2. **A correctness axis**. Per (system, mix, θ, clients) cell, the
   fraction of contested slots whose actual live-row
   `(kind, spec, conf, value)` matches the lattice-max over ALL
   workload write attempts (committed or aborted).
3. **A goodput metric**: `throughput × (1 - abort_rate) ×
   correctness_rate` — correct commits per second.
4. **A kind-mix sweep**: easy (90/9/1), moderate (70/20/10),
   adversarial (33/33/33 INFERRED/MEASURED/DERIVED). This is the
   new axis; Stage 1's fixed 70/20/10 corresponds to `moderate`.
5. **Disable-and-test transcripts** for KNDB, LLM-gated,
   evidence-weighted, and majority-vote — each mechanism turned off
   in isolation to show it is load-bearing for that baseline's
   correctness rate.

## The four Stage 2 baselines

### `pg_lww` — last-write-wins

Plain heap + BEFORE INSERT trigger. On every incoming write:
`SELECT ctid FROM fact_lww WHERE entity_id = NEW.entity_id AND
attribute = NEW.attribute AND upper(sys_time) = 'infinity'
LIMIT 1 FOR UPDATE`; if found, `UPDATE ... SET sys_time =
tstzrange(lower(sys_time), clock_timestamp())`; return NEW.
Never rejects. Same shape as every other trigger baseline.

We used to try `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT (entity_id, attribute)
WHERE upper_inf(sys_time) DO UPDATE`. Two gotchas: (i) `upper_inf`
returns FALSE on ranges whose upper is a literal `+infinity`
timestamptz (RANGE_UB_INF flag unset), so the partial unique
predicate `WHERE upper_inf(sys_time)` catches zero rows and
ON CONFLICT silently never fires — the correct predicate is
`WHERE upper(sys_time) = 'infinity'::timestamptz`. (ii) ON CONFLICT
DO UPDATE mutates the same physical row rather than closing +
inserting; that breaks the preseed-preserving reset (the mutated
row no longer matches the preseed signature and gets deleted).
The trigger-based shape avoids both. Schema:
`bench/schema/pg_lww.sql`. Full rationale in `DECISIONS.md` (F10).

### `pg_llm` — LLM-gated resolver (MOCK)

Plain heap + BEFORE INSERT trigger that, on conflict:

1. Reads incumbent `(kind, spec, conf, value)`.
2. Computes the lattice-correct verdict internally (this is the
   "ground truth" the LLM is trying to reproduce).
3. Sleeps a log-normal latency (mean 200 ms by default, sigma 0.5).
4. Emits the lattice-correct verdict with probability `P_correct`
   (0.65 default), otherwise the opposite.
5. If the verdict is NEW-wins, closes incumbent sys_time and lets
   NEW proceed; otherwise raises NEW_LOSES.

**Real API vs mock**. We did not call a real LLM. Anthropic /
OpenAI keys are not plumbed to this cluster and the Cloro
credential in the standing context is a live-billed key we were
not authorised to spend against for automated benching. The mock's
parameters are calibrated against public numbers:

- **Latency**: log-normal, mean 200 ms, sigma 0.5. Calibrated
  against published single-shot latency for Claude Haiku 4.5
  (100-500 ms) and GPT-4o-mini (200-800 ms) on ~500-input/
  ~50-output-token structured prompts. 200 ms is the low-middle
  of both, deliberately generous to LLM-gated.
- **P_correct = 0.65**. Calibrated against Mem0 / MemGPT-follow-up
  reports on the LOCOMO memory benchmark's conflict-resolution
  subtask, which puts prompted-LLM accuracy in the 60-75% range.
  We sit near the middle. A higher value would be dishonest given
  no real API was called.

Toggles (all `SET`-time GUCs): `bench.fact_llm_p_correct`,
`bench.fact_llm_latency_mean`, `bench.fact_llm_latency_sigma`,
`bench.fact_llm_mode` (`on`/`off`), `bench.fact_llm_disable_test`
(when `1`, forces P_correct=0.5).

### `pg_conf` — evidence-weighted / confidence-only

Plain heap + BEFORE INSERT trigger that keeps whichever row has
strictly higher `ep_confidence`. On tie, keep incumbent
(first-committer-wins, matching KNDB F8). Ignores kind and
specificity. Approximates truth-discovery / reliability-aware DBs
that only trust a scalar row-level confidence. Toggle:
`bench.fact_conf_mode = 'off'` degrades to LWW.

### `pg_mv` — streaming majority-vote

Plain heap + BEFORE INSERT trigger that maintains a per-slot
`(entity_id, attribute, value) -> vote_count` sketch in an
auxiliary table `fact_mv_votes`. Increments votes on NEW, picks
the current argmax value, and lets NEW proceed only if
`NEW.value = argmax`; otherwise raises. Ties in vote count are
broken lexicographically for determinism. Streaming approximate,
not batched — batched majority-vote would commit writes instantly
and resolve later, off the closed-loop path; since correctness is
measured at end-of-window, batched and streaming converge.
Toggle: `bench.fact_mv_mode = 'off'` degrades to LWW.

## Correctness metric

For every write attempt (committed or aborted, during warmup or
measurement) the driver records `(t_ns, slot, kind, spec, conf,
value, committed)` in a per-worker Python list. At end-of-window
these are merged into a single time-ordered trace, and per slot we
compute the **lattice-maximal bucket** `(kind, spec, conf)`
across the preseed row and every write attempt:

- kind rank MEASURED (3) > DERIVED (2) > INFERRED (1)
- higher `ep_specificity` wins at same kind rank
- higher `ep_confidence` wins at same (kind, spec)
- on a true (kind, spec, conf) tie the set of tied values is kept
  as a legal-winner set (any specific value is a lattice-legal
  survivor; the lattice itself does not pin one — KNDB uses xmin,
  other systems use wall clock / hash / etc)

The correctness scorer compares the live row's `(kind, spec,
conf)` to the lattice-max and its `value` to the tied-value set.
Correctness rate = matches / contested slot count. Contested slots
are those with ≥ 2 distinct-content writes across the whole trace.

**Why compute the lattice-max over ALL attempts, not just
commits?** The lattice's job is to preserve the epistemically
strongest write from the pool of INTENTS the workload sent to the
database. A system that rejects a MEASURED intent (because e.g.
its trigger got the wrong answer, or the LLM guessed wrong, or
`pg_conf` only checked confidence) has failed to preserve the
lattice-max. Committing after the rejection does not make the
outcome correct. This is the honest test.

Additionally, live rows with `n_live != 1` (either 0 or > 1) count
as incorrect regardless of value match.

Reading:

- **KNDB epistemic hits 100.0% on every one of the 12 cells.**
  This is the paper's headline: the lattice as an engine-level
  primitive achieves complete correctness across the entire mix ×
  theta × concurrency grid.
- **pg_conf** does the coincidentally-best job on adversarial
  (77-81%) because MEASURED / DERIVED writes all carry
  `ep_confidence = 1.0` and beat the preseed's 0.5; but its
  accidental alignment breaks on `easy` (54%) where 90% of writes
  are INFERRED with random conf in [0, 1) and the confidence tie
  logic can't order kinds.
- **pg_lww** is remarkably stable at 83-93% — because with hot
  Zipfian slots and MEASURED writes distributed uniformly, the
  LAST write to a hot slot is often MEASURED and happens to align
  with the lattice-max. On `easy` (fewer MEASURED writes) LWW
  drops; on `adversarial` (33% MEASURED) it recovers. **LWW's
  "correctness" is a workload artifact, not a mechanism.**
- **pg_mv** matches pg_lww shape almost exactly. Because YCSB
  generates unique values per write, each vote count is 1 and the
  argmax is picked lexicographically — effectively random. pg_mv
  and LWW converge in an open-vocabulary setting.
- **pg_llm** at P_correct=0.65 lands at 62-68% across every
  cell — matching the mock parameter almost exactly. Consistent
  under-performance is the mechanism, not variance.
- **pg_trigger** drops sharply on adversarial (67-69%) because
  its R1 rule is inverted vs the AM's (trigger says "DERIVED must
  have NO sources", AM says "DERIVED must have sources"). The
  workload always attaches a source, so trigger rejects every
  DERIVED write. 33% DERIVED rate ≈ 33% of contested slots miss.
  Documented but not fixed in this pass (F11 item).
- **pg_heap** is 0.0% on every cell. No arbitration, no eviction:
  every write appears as a fresh live row (see integrity table
  below). At 100 k slots and 20+ k writes per cell, tens of
  thousands of slots end with `n_live > 1`.

### Goodput (correct commits per second)

`goodput = throughput × (1 - abort_rate) × correctness_rate`.

Reading:

- **pg_llm collapses by two orders of magnitude on goodput**
  (30-40 correct/s vs 1500-3500 for KNDB). The 200 ms mock
  latency + the 65% correctness compound. On adversarial theta 0.9
  the LLM-gated cell is the only one where a real workload would
  literally fail its SLA. LLM-gated at 32 clients was skipped
  entirely — the `pg_sleep` under `FOR UPDATE` collapses effective
  concurrency to 1 on hot slots.
- **pg_heap is the fastest raw and the worst goodput.** No
  arbitration → 0% correctness → 0 goodput.
- **KNDB epistemic is highest goodput on 9 of 12 cells.** LWW
  edges it out on three cells (easy θ=0.9 c8/c32, and mod
  θ=0.9 c32) — but each of those LWW cells came with
  10-67 duplicate live rows (integrity gap) that a real workload
  cannot tolerate.

KNDB epistemic never lands a duplicate live row across the entire
grid, even at 32 clients on hot Zipfian. LWW's atomicity gap gets
worse with concurrency: 10-14 dups at 8 clients, 59-71 at 32.

### Disable-and-test transcripts

All at kind_mix=adversarial, θ=0.9, 8 clients (the mix where each
mechanism has the most work to do).

| mechanism | mode | tps | abort | correctness | goodput | multi_live |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| KNDB epistemic | reference (lattice on) | 3,094 | 0.275 | **100.0%** | 2,243 | 0 |
| KNDB epistemic | disabled (= run pg_heap) | 8,281 | 0.000 | **0.0%** | 0 | 31,667 |
| LLM (mock) | reference (P_correct=0.65) | 65 | 0.173 | **65.5%** | 35 | 8 |
| LLM (mock) | disabled (P_correct=0.5) | 60 | 0.224 | **51.3%** | 24 | 6 |
| evidence-weighted | reference (conf-check on) | 2,567 | 0.333 | **76.1%** | 1,303 | 1 |
| evidence-weighted | disabled (= LWW) | 2,961 | 0.000 | 84.5% | 2,501 | 42 |
| majority-vote | reference | 2,434 | 0.260 | **84.0%** | 1,514 | 3 |
| majority-vote | disabled (pin votes = LWW) | 2,910 | 0.000 | 84.4% | 2,457 | 43 |

Reading:

- **KNDB epistemic disable-and-test is external.** This pass does
  not touch `src/` and cannot rebuild the AM with
  `epistemic_precedence_cmp` forced to `NEW_WINS`. The meaningful
  lattice-off comparator is pg_heap: no arbitration, everything
  commits, correctness collapses to 0.0% and 31,667 slots end with
  duplicate live rows. That IS the disable-and-test proof: the
  lattice is load-bearing for both the correctness rate AND the
  "exactly one live per slot" integrity invariant.
- **LLM disable-and-test at P_correct=0.5 collapses correctness to
  51.3%** — cleanly matching the Bernoulli. The 65.5%-vs-51.3%
  spread (~14 percentage points) is the LLM's actual added value
  over random guessing, and it is exactly the mock's `0.65 - 0.5`
  = 15%. The mock is behaving as designed.
- **Evidence-weighted disable-and-test is a surprise finding.**
  On the adversarial mix at θ=0.9 the confidence check ACTUALLY
  HURTS correctness (76.1% → 84.5% when disabled, i.e. LWW is
  better than confidence-only). The confidence check rejects
  low-conf INFERRED workload writes even when they should have
  won by kind rank or specificity; LWW accepts them. On this
  cell, the "mechanism" is anti-load-bearing — that is a real,
  reportable property of confidence-only arbitration and it is
  something the paper needs to say plainly. On other cells
  (easy, moderate) the confidence check helps; but the fact that
  it can hurt on adversarial mixes is exactly the case KNDB's
  full lattice avoids. Note the 42 duplicate live rows the
  disabled cell produces — again the LWW trigger's RC atomicity
  gap.
- **Majority-vote disable-and-test is nearly a no-op** (84.0% →
  84.4%). Because YCSB generates unique values per write, pg_mv's
  argmax picks lex-smallest, which is effectively random —
  behaviorally close to LWW's "keep the last write". The
  mechanism does not add real signal to this workload; the
  paper needs to caveat this precisely.

## Findings that surprised F10

1. **pg_lww's 83-93% "correctness" is a workload artifact.**
   Under Zipfian hot spots the last write to a slot is
   disproportionately MEASURED, which happens to align with the
   lattice-max. It looks like LWW works. It does not — the
   correctness rate depends entirely on the kind mix and a real
   adversarial workload (e.g. a burst of low-conf INFERRED writes
   after a MEASURED) would collapse it. But at benchmark time
   this is enough to mislead casual reviewers, which is
   noteworthy for the paper's story about "just use PostgreSQL".
2. **pg_conf's `easy` mix result (54%) is worse than random for
   contested slots.** The bench triggers a 46% wrong answer rate.
   The mechanism does actively pick a losing row, not just miss
   the right one — because 50% of INFERRED workload writes have
   `ep_confidence > preseed's 0.5` and get accepted even when
   their spec is 0 (should lose to preseed by first-committer).
3. **pg_lww under RC has an atomicity gap.** Two concurrent
   inserts to the same slot both find "no incumbent" via
   `SELECT FOR UPDATE` (empty scans don't lock), both commit,
   live-row count = 2. At 32 clients on easy θ=0.9 we see 67 such
   duplicate slots per 20-second window. A partial unique index
   would close this, but breaks the reset (see DECISIONS.md).
   Documented as a real property of "just add a trigger" LWW.
4. **pg_mv converges to LWW in open-vocabulary settings.** YCSB
   generates unique values per write, so every vote count is 1;
   the argmax picks the lex-smallest value, which is effectively
   random. In a closed-vocabulary setting (e.g. medical-code
   updates over a small set of allowed values) majority-vote
   would work; here it does not.
5. **KNDB epistemic scales to 32 clients on hot Zipfian without
   losing an integrity assertion**, even under adversarial mix
   where 33% of writes are DERIVED with the AM's specific R1
   requirements. The advisory-lock + xmin design carries through.

Reading:

- **pg_llm p99 is 442-753 ms across every cell**, because every
  contested write pays a full mock-latency sample under `FOR UPDATE`.
  At c=32 (skipped in the correctness grid) the cell would still
  run; it just wouldn't finish enough writes to matter.
- **pg_lww p99.9 at c=32 is 53 ms** vs epistemic's 17 ms — this
  is the SELECT FOR UPDATE contention on hot slots when the LWW
  trigger's dup-tolerating design lets more writers race.
- **KNDB epistemic scales latency almost linearly** with client
  count (p50 goes 0.9 → 1.75 → 6.75 ms; p99 2.5 → 4.0 → 13 ms).
- pg_heap is fastest raw at c=1 and c=8 (no arbitration overhead)
  but degrades at c=32 (5,200 tps vs 6,000 at c=8) as heap-append
  cache pressure grows.

## Time budget

The correctness grid (78 cells at 20 s meas + 3 s warm-up + ~1 s
reset per cell) took ~50 minutes wall clock, plus one-time preseeds
per system (~4-5 s each). Disable-and-test and control grids run
after, adding another ~20 minutes. Total Stage 2 wall clock: ~70
minutes.

Trims from the ideal:

- Only 1 run per cell (vs Stage 1's 3). The correctness axis is
  driven by structural behavior of the mechanism, not run-to-run
  noise; one run captures the mechanism's shape faithfully.
- LLM-gated cells at 32 clients were **skipped**. The
  `pg_sleep(0.2)` inside a `FOR UPDATE` block collapses effective
  concurrency to 1 on hot slots; the cell would have run for
  hours to produce a comparable sample count.
- Measurement window shortened to 20 s from Stage 1's 30 s. This
  reduces contested-slot count per cell but preserves the shape.

## Explicit caveats per baseline

- **pg_lww**: partial-unique + ON CONFLICT was rejected in favour
  of a trigger-based LWW (see design notes above). The trigger
  has a documented RC atomicity gap (dup live rows) that we
  report rather than paper over.
- **pg_llm (mock)**: NOT A REAL LLM. Log-normal 200 ms latency +
  Bernoulli P=0.65 correctness. Real LLMs will exhibit
  prompt-sensitivity, context-length degradation, tool-use
  variance, and rate-limit spikes — none of which are modelled.
  The bench's LLM cells are a **best-case** for LLM-gated
  resolution.
- **pg_conf**: workload's MEASURED / DERIVED writes have
  `ep_confidence = 1.0` and preseed is 0.5. Correctness on easy
  mix (mostly INFERRED, random conf) is worst; on adversarial
  (33% MEASURED with conf=1) it is coincidentally close to LWW.
  The accidental alignment is the point.
- **pg_mv**: streaming approximate. On open-vocabulary workloads
  (YCSB's fresh 40-char values per write) it degrades to
  effectively random pick. A batched majority-vote against a
  fixed-vocabulary workload would perform differently.
- **pg_trigger**: R1 inverted vs the AM. Rejects every DERIVED
  write (workload always attaches a source). F11 item.
- **All baselines**: seqscan-only (Stage 1's limitation carries
  forward). No secondary index anywhere; every write pays an
  overlap probe. Absolute throughput low; relative comparison
  is what matters.

## F14 addendum: integrity-aware correctness table

F14 sweeps the Stage 2 raw JSONs and annotates each cell with an
`integrity_status` field. A cell FAILS integrity if the target table
had ANY (entity, attribute) slot with more than one live row at
end-of-window (i.e. the "exactly one live row per slot" invariant was
violated). When integrity has failed, the numeric correctness rate is
a scorer artefact — the scorer picked whichever duplicate the sequential
scan returned first — so F14 renders it as `INTEGRITY FAIL` instead of
a number. The raw number remains in the JSON under
`correctness.correctness_rate_ignoring_integrity` and in
`stage2_correctness.csv` under the same column name.

Re-rendered table (identical inputs, F14-integrity-aware output):

Reading:

- **KNDB epistemic is the only system that passes integrity on every
  Stage 2 cell.** This flows directly from the F6 advisory xact lock
  (`epistemic_tuple_insert_impl`) and F8 xmin tiebreak: two racing
  writers on the same (entity, attribute) slot serialise on the lock
  and only one commits a live row. No trigger-based baseline holds this
  invariant across the sweep.
- **Every trigger baseline fails integrity at 32 clients.** The RC
  atomicity gap documented in F10 (two concurrent inserts both find
  "no incumbent" via `SELECT FOR UPDATE`, both commit) is not unique
  to pg_lww — it hits pg_conf, pg_mv, pg_trigger, and pg_llm too. The
  cells that PASS integrity are single-writer-favourable (moderate mix,
  c=8, θ=0.5) where the race window is narrow.
- **pg_conf and pg_heap fail on EVERY cell.** pg_conf's trigger rejects
  low-conf incumbents but doesn't take a lock that serialises another
  concurrent trigger's decision, so at c>=8 both concurrent writers
  can each conclude they beat the incumbent. pg_heap of course has no
  arbitration and no eviction.

The F13-era numbers in the earlier table (pg_lww 83-93%, pg_conf 54-81%)
are **the correctness rate the scorer would have reported had the
"exactly one live per slot" invariant held**. It didn't. Both numbers
belong in the paper, distinguished, not either one alone.

## F14 addendum: files touched

- `bench/driver/correctness.py` — records `integrity_status` and
  `correctness_rate_ignoring_integrity` in every new cell's JSON.
- `bench/driver/summarize_stage2.py` — CSV gets new columns
  `correctness_median_ignoring_integrity` and `integrity_status`.
- `bench/scripts_stage3/backfill_integrity.py` — retroactively annotates
  the existing raw JSONs so downstream summarizers see a consistent
  schema. Stage 2 cells are annotated in-place from their pre-existing
  `multiple_live_rows` field (no replay needed); Stage 3 Book-Author
  cells were replayed against a fresh cluster because they didn't
  record live-row counts.
- `bench/results/summary/stage2.md` — this addendum.
