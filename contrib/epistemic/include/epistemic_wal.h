/*
 * epistemic_wal.h
 *
 * Custom WAL resource manager for the epistemic AM. Registered at
 * RM_EPISTEMIC_ID (== RM_EXPERIMENTAL_ID = 128) from _PG_init.
 *
 * Scope after F3 audit: this rmgr is an ANNOTATION CHANNEL, not a
 * durability channel. Heap's own XLOG_HEAP_INSERT record carries the
 * full tuple body (including ep_kind, ep_specificity, ep_confidence,
 * sources — every user column) via XLogRegisterBufData; heap's WAL
 * plus heap_xlog_insert already recovers every byte of the row. The
 * epistemic record adds nothing to recovery. See DECISIONS.md (F3
 * entry) for the disable-and-retest proof and the PG 18 source
 * citations (heapam.c:2222-2226 in REL_18_STABLE for the register
 * calls, heapam_xlog.c:482-503 for the redo path).
 *
 * The rmgr is registered so that (a) pg_get_wal_resource_managers()
 * reports id 128 as 'epistemic' (verified by sql/wal.sql), and (b) the
 * annotation channel is reserved for a future consumer. rm_decode is
 * NULL, so logical decoding (decode.c:LogicalDecodingProcessRecord
 * skips records with a null rm_decode at lines 115-117) does not
 * surface the record. PG 18's standalone pg_waldump does not load
 * custom rmgrs, so external decoding is unavailable today; rm_desc is
 * reached only via in-process wal_debug tracing. No downstream
 * consumer exists.
